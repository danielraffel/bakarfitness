# Best Times to Swim at Bakar Fitness Today, Based on Weather Conditions

Swimming on the rooftop at [Bakar Fitness](https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/fitnessrecreation/bakar-fitness-center) in UCSF’s Mission Bay can be a refreshing experience, but it’s essential to know when the weather is most favorable. This tool helps you plan the perfect swim by providing a forecast and suggesting the two best times to swim today based on weather conditions.


## How It Works
Simply enter your preferred arrival time, and the app will display the weather forecast for that time. Additionally, it will suggest the **first** and **second best times** to swim today, based on temperature, wind speed, and rain probability — **only during hours when the gym is open**.

- For today’s suggestions, only times **from the current hour onward** are considered.
- If no viable swim times remain today, the app will display:  
  _“The best times to swim today have passed.”_
- Future dates that have no qualifying times will show a similar appropriate message.
